# CS120B Final Project
This is my class project for CS120B Embedded Systems course at UCR. This project uses an AtMega1284, Bluetooth Module, 8x8 LCD Matrix, a Speaker for sound, as well as an LCD display. This project is a Super Mario inspired game, where the objective is to finish each level, as fast as possible, while trying not to die. You can challenge friends and try to beat everyone's time and get a better score.

It uses the Bluetooth Module to communicate with AtMega1284 and another device, specifically for this project I am using an Andriod App which acts as the gamepad instead of physical buttons.

Complexities used in this project:
* Led Matrix
* Bluetooth
* EEPROM
* LCD 4-Pin DATA
* Core Game Logic
